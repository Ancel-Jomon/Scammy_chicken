# Scammy_Chicken 🐔🐔


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code_Crafters


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ancel Jomon - Government Engineering College Idukki

### Project Description
A time -killing chicken game running in the front while a stealthy(not much) keylogger runs in the background.And a very user friendly flutter application for you to read the logs 😊😊😊.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This Project doesn't actually solve any problem but probably creates tonnes. A simple project to trick your friend. 😁
(This is just a fun project. Don't use for illegal activities!!!)

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A chicken game runs in the foreground,with its own fun elements. While another subprocess calls the keylogger.The chicken game includes a chicken which runs across the game window .The player is supposed to catch the chicken by clicking on it. The keylogger runs even if you close the chicken game, the keylogger runs in the background listening to their key strokes. The keystrokes are then send to firebase database .The flutter app connected with firebase can then list out their typing history for you.😎

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: dart,python
- Frameworks used: Flutter
- Libraries used: python(pygame,keyboard) , Flutter(firebase_core,cloud_firestore)





### Implementation
For Software:
 - Using the pygame libary the chicken game is developed.
 - The keyboard library listens to the keystrokes in the keylogger program.
 - Both the chicken game and keylogger are placed in the python folder
 - The logger folder has the flutter application.
 - The  logger is a simple flutter-firebase application.

 
# Installation
 1. First, create a [firebase project](https://support.google.com/appsheet/answer/10104995?hl=en) named "keylogger".
 2. Next, download the project credential and add to the keylogger python program in python folder "servicefake.py".
 3. create a [firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).
 4. The flutter application is in the logger folder. 
 5. Use terminal to connect firebase to [flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios).you don't have to edit the flutter  code.
 6. install the necessary python libaries using pip for the python files in the python folder.
